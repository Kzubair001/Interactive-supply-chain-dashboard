# Interactive-supply-chain-dashboard
# Project Description:
The Supply Chain Performance Dashboard project aims to develop a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into various aspects of the supply chain. This dashboard will be designed to help supply chain managers and stakeholders monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify bottlenecks, optimize operations, and enhance decision-making processes.

# Objectives:
1.Real-Time Monitoring: Provide up-to-date information on supply chain activities. 
2.Performance Tracking: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate supply chain efficiency. 
3.Bottleneck Identification: Identify areas where delays or inefficiencies occur. 
4.Cost Management: Monitor and control supply chain costs. 
5.Inventory Management: Optimize inventory levels to balance supply and demand. 6.Supplier Performance: Evaluate and compare supplier performance. 
7.Demand Forecasting: Predict future demand to improve planning and procurement.

# Key Insights:
Overall Performance: The dashboard shows several high-level KPIs, including:

1.16.6% (likely an important metric, possibly Inventory Forecast)
2.72.2% OTD (On-Time Delivery)
3.9.72% OTIF (On-Time In Full)
4.66.0% LIFR (Line Item Fill Rate) 
5.97% VOFR (possibly Volume Order Fill Rate) 
6.City-wise Performance: The dashboard breaks down performance metrics by cities, comparing actual performance to targets for metrics like IF (Inventory Forecast), OT (On-Time), and OTIF.
